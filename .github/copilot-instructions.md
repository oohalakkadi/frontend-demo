# Gray Matter Recruitment System - Copilot Instructions

This is a static frontend application for a recruitment management system called "Gray Matter". When working on this project, please follow these guidelines:

## Design System
- Use gray and white color spectrum only (no black elements)
- Use Prociono font for headings (already imported from Google Fonts)
- Use simple sans-serif for body text
- Maintain clean, modern UI with subtle shadows and rounded corners
- Follow the existing spacing and layout patterns

## Code Structure
- Keep vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Organize CSS with clear sections and comments
- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) features
- Maintain responsive design patterns

## User Roles & Features
The system supports 4 user roles with specific permissions:
1. **Recruiter**: Job posting, candidate management, interview scheduling
2. **Technical Manager**: Candidate review, technical interviews, feedback
3. **Account Manager**: Client management, candidate submission, job tracking
4. **Admin**: System configuration, audit trail, user management

## Key Features to Maintain
- Role-based navigation and content visibility
- Interactive dashboard with role-specific metrics
- Job management with status tracking
- Applicant database with matching scores
- Resume upload and processing interface
- Mock authentication flow

## Icon Usage
- Use Font Awesome icons consistently
- Prefer outline/regular style icons over solid when appropriate
- Maintain icon sizing consistency (1.25rem for most cases)

## Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with breakpoint at 768px
- Collapsible sidebar on mobile
- Responsive grid layouts
- Touch-friendly interface elements

When suggesting improvements or new features, ensure they align with the recruitment workflow requirements outlined in the original specification.
